# Student Management System


## PROCEDURES

### Navigation Bar
Since the NavBar is common for all pages (except logins), it is the first obstacle to clear. We will use Bootstrap 5 to decorate the navigation bar.

### Login Page
Login Page is added from Bootstrap examples `SignIn Form`. The authentication will later be handled by respective views function.
