## PROCEDURES

### Navigation Bar
Since the NavBar is common for all pages (except logins), it is the first obstacle to clear. We will use Bootstrap 5 to decorate the navigation bar.

### Login Page
Login Page is added from Bootstrap examples `SignIn Form`. The authentication will later be handled by respective views function.

### Authentication (Logging In and Out)
The authentication is handled by the functions provided by the Django framework.

### Index Page
The index page is made simple with example `Cover` provided by Bootstrap.
